## ðŸš€ Overview

This project implements a **state-of-the-art** convolutional neural network (CNN) pipeline for **multi-class** brain cancer detection from MRI scans. Leveraging real-time data augmentation, hyperparameter optimization (Keras Tuner Hyperband), and thorough evaluation metrics, we achieve **>94% validation accuracy** on the Orvile Brain Cancer MRI dataset.  

> **Impact:** Early and accurate detection of brain tumors can significantly improve patient outcomes. This open-source pipeline offers researchers and clinicians a turnkey solution to train, evaluate, and deploy high-accuracy diagnostic models.
